<!-- LETTERS -->
<section id="l1" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>My pretty wife, happy Valentine’s Day. I don’t think love is supposed to be proven in one day, or in gifts, or in big gestures. I think love is proven in choosing the same person over and over again, even on the quiet days, even on the hard days. And Tanisha, I choose you. Every single time. You came into my life and somehow made everything feel warmer, calmer, and more meaningful. You don’t just make me happy, muh luvvv… you make me feel at peace. And that peace is something I never knew I needed until you gave it to me. I’m grateful for you, for your heart, for your presence, for the way you love me. You’re not just my Valentine. You’re my person.</div></section>
<section id="l2" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>I don’t remember the exact moment I fell for you. I just remember realizing one day that my world feels incomplete when I haven’t talked to you. That my mood changes when I hear your voice. That my smile shows up without me trying when I see your name. I’m not casually in love with you, babe. I’m not halfway in love with you. I’m deeply, stupidly, permanently in love with you. You live in my thoughts, in my heart, in my plans. Loving you feels natural, like breathing. And I don’t want a future that doesn’t have you in it.</div></section>
<section id="l3" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>Muh lady, I’m working on myself for a reason. I want to become a better man. Stronger mentally. Smarter. More disciplined. More stable. Not just for me, but because I want to be someone who can give you the life you deserve. One day I want to stand in front of you and proudly say I’m ready to build a life with you. Ready to protect you. Ready to provide. Ready to love you in every season. You are not a distraction from my goals, Tanisha. You are one of the biggest reasons I have goals in the first place.</div></section>
<section id="l4" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>My luvvv, I know my past has hurt you. I know some things I’ve been through make you scared, unsure, or overthink. And I’m truly sorry for that. I never want to be the reason you feel unsafe in love. Please believe me when I say this: I am not who I used to be. I’ve grown. I’ve learned. I know exactly what I want now. And what I want is you. Only you. Not temporarily. Not as an option. But as my person.</div></section>
<section id="l5" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>Can we talk about how unfairly pretty you are? Like seriously. You walk around being that beautiful and expect me to act normal? Your smile messes me up. Your face lives in my head rent free. You don’t even try and yet you drive me crazy. And the best part? You’re mine. My pretty wife. And I’m yours. I don’t take that lightly at all.</div></section>
<section id="l6" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>You’ve become my comfort.Sometimes I sit quietly and think about you, and my chest just feels full. Full of love. Full of gratitude. Full of something I don’t even have words for. You’ve become my comfort. My safe place. My calm when everything feels heavy. On days when I feel tired or lost, the thought of you gives me strength. Loving you has changed me in the best way, Tanisha. And I don’t ever want to lose what we have.</div></section>
<section id="l7" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>Babe, I want to see you win in life. I want to see you succeed, smile proudly, and become everything you dream of becoming. I’ll never be the kind of man who holds you back. We’re two people growing together. Two people chasing their own futures while choosing each other at the same time. I’m not going anywhere. I’m right here. Supporting you. Believing in you. Loving you through everything.</div></section>

<!-- SECRET LETTER -->
<section id="secret" class="screen hidden"><div class="page"><div class="back" onclick="back()">← Back</div>My muh pretty wife Tanisha, I don’t even know where to start because every part of me feels full when I think of you. You’re not just beautiful—you’re captivating in ways I didn’t know were possible. Your smile lights up my darkest days, your voice calms the chaos in my mind, and even the little things you do, like the way you laugh or the way you call me “babe” or “handsome,” make my heart skip every single time. You are my safe place, my favorite thought, my addiction in the best way, and the person I can’t imagine my life without. I love you more than words could ever capture—more than I could ever show—but I want you to feel it in every text, every look, every heartbeat I have for you. Loving you has changed me, Tanisha. It’s made me kinder, stronger, and more alive. You make me want to be the best version of myself because you deserve nothing less than everything I have and more. I love your laugh, your warmth, your stubbornness, your sweetness, your honesty, your intelligence, and yes, your insane way of making me weak in the knees without even trying. Every time I think of losing you—even for a second—my chest hurts because you aren’t just part of my life, babe… you’re my life. You’re the thought I wake up with, the reason I push myself every day, the person I dream about when I sleep, and the one I want to build my entire future around. You are my obsession, my comfort, my pride, my partner-in-crime, and the only one I ever want to call my lady, my pretty wife, my muh luvvv. I choose you today, tomorrow, and always, and I swear I’ll spend the rest of my life making sure you never doubt how loved, wanted, and cherished you are. So if there’s one thing I want you to know above all else, it’s this: Tanisha, losing you is impossible because my heart has already chosen you fully, completely, and forever—and even that isn’t enough to measure how much I love you.</div></section>
